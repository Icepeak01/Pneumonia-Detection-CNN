# Pneumonia-Detection-CNN

## Overview
Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify X-ray images for pneumonia detection and incorporate explainability techniques to visualize the modelâ€™s decision-making process.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, model training, evaluation, and explainability.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, model training, evaluation, and serving.
- `models/`: Trained model files.
- `app/`: Web application for model inference.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for project automation.
- `deployment/`: Instructions for deploying the model locally and on the cloud.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Prepare the dataset as per the instructions in the `data/` directory.
4. Run the notebooks and scripts as needed.

## Usage
- **Data Exploration:** `notebooks/notebook.ipynb`
- **Training:** `src/train.py`
- **Prediction:** `src/predict.py`
- **Web Service:** `app/app.py`
